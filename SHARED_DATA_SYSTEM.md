# Shared Data System Migration

## Overview
The website has been migrated from localStorage to a shared GitHub-based data system. Now anyone can visit the site and their actions (deleting files, marking files as OK/NOT OK, adding comments) will be visible to all other users.

## How It Works

### Data Storage
- **Before**: All data stored in browser's localStorage (private to each user)
- **After**: All data stored in JSON files in your GitHub repository (shared across all users)

### JSON Files Created
1. `deleted_files_history.json` - Tracks deleted audio files (already existed)
2. `completed_files.json` - Tracks files marked as OK/completed
3. `file_comments.json` - Stores user comments on audio files
4. `not_completed_files.json` - Tracks files marked as NOT OK

### GitHub Integration
- Uses GitHub Contents API to read/write JSON files
- No authentication required (anonymous commits)
- Changes are automatically committed to your repository
- Vercel automatically redeploys when files change

### User Experience
- **Same UI/UX**: No visible changes to users
- **Real-time sharing**: Actions are immediately visible to all users
- **Persistent**: Data survives browser restarts and different devices
- **Anonymous**: No login required

### Technical Changes
- Added `GitHubAPI` class to handle GitHub interactions
- Replaced localStorage methods with async GitHub API calls
- Modified all save operations to commit to GitHub
- Added `loadSharedData()` to fetch current state on page load

## File Structure
```
/your-repo/
├── deleted_files_history.json    # Deleted files (existing)
├── completed_files.json          # Completed/OK files (new)
├── file_comments.json            # User comments (new)
├── not_completed_files.json      # NOT OK files (new)
└── script.js                     # Updated with GitHub integration
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Zero cost (uses existing GitHub + Vercel setup)
- ✅ No additional infrastructure needed
- ✅ Automatic backups via Git history
- ✅ Transparent and auditable (all changes visible in repo)
- ✅ No user authentication required
- ✅ Scales automatically with GitHub's infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Test the system by visiting your website
2. Try marking files as OK/NOT OK and adding comments
3. Open the site in another browser/device to verify sharing works
4. Monitor your GitHub repository for automatic commits

The system is now fully operational and ready for shared use!
